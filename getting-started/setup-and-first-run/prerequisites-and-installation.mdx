## Preparing Your Environment for ABCJSPlugin Installation

Before you begin setting up the ABCJSPlugin, it’s essential to ensure your system meets the necessary requirements and dependencies. This page guides you through the foundational steps to prepare your environment, laying the groundwork for a smooth installation process tailored for your platform.

The ABCJSPlugin integrates closely with the Obsidian note-taking app, relying on specific versions and compatible dependencies to function effectively. Ensuring these prerequisites upfront saves you from common setup hurdles and streamlines your path to leveraging music notation capabilities within Obsidian.

---

## Essential Prerequisites and Dependencies

To install and run the ABCJSPlugin successfully, start by confirming that your system has the following:

- **Obsidian**: The plugin is designed exclusively for Obsidian, so you must have Obsidian installed on your device. 
- **Environment Compatibility**: The plugin is tested on major desktop platforms where Obsidian runs, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Node.js and npm**: For development or manual installation from source, Node.js (version 14 or newer) and npm must be installed to manage dependencies.
- **Critical External Libraries**: The plugin depends on the external abcjs library for rendering music notation and the Obsidian API types.

These dependencies are automatically handled when installing through the official Obsidian plugin interface. However, if you intend to work with source code or develop the plugin, these prerequisites are mandatory.

## Installing ABCJSPlugin via Obsidian

Installing ABCJSPlugin through the Obsidian community plugins system provides the simplest and most reliable setup method. This approach handles all dependencies and setups internally.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Obsidian Settings">
Open Obsidian and click the gear icon in the lower-left corner to open Settings.
</Step>
<Step title="Enable Community Plugins">
Under 'Options,' select 'Community Plugins.' Toggle on 'Safe Mode' if it is off (you will be warned about trusted plugins).
</Step>
<Step title="Find ABCJSPlugin">
Click 'Browse' and search for 'ABCJSPlugin' in the community plugin list.
</Step>
<Step title="Install the Plugin">
Select ABCJSPlugin and click 'Install'. Wait for the installation to complete.
</Step>
<Step title="Enable the Plugin">
After installation, return to the plugins list and enable ABCJSPlugin by toggling it on.
</Step>
</Steps>

You should now have ABCJSPlugin running within Obsidian, enabling music notation rendering.

## Manual Installation from Source

For users interested in modifying or building ABCJSPlugin themselves, follow this manual installation path which sets up the development environment.

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the Repository">
Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abcjs-music/obsidian-plugin-abcjs.git
cd obsidian-plugin-abcjs
```
</Step>
<Step title="Install Dependencies">
Run npm to install all required packages including abcjs and Obsidian type definitions:

```bash
npm install
```
</Step>
<Step title="Build the Plugin">
Compile the TypeScript source into JavaScript:

```bash
npm run build
```
</Step>
<Step title="Load into Obsidian">
Follow Obsidian’s developer guidelines to load the plugin from your local build directory.
</Step>
</Steps>

This method requires familiarity with Node.js and plugin development for Obsidian.

## Configuration Essentials

After installation, ABCJSPlugin does not require initial configuration to operate. However, you can customize certain aspects via the plugin’s settings tab within Obsidian's Settings panel. Configuration settings control how music notation is rendered and interact with the Obsidian API’s MarkdownPostProcessorContext type.

Here is a minimal configuration example that shows how the plugin loads settings on start:

```typescript
async loadSettings() {
  this.settings = Object.assign({}, DEFAULT_SETTINGS, await this.loadData());
}
```

This code snippet is part of the main plugin class and ensures default values are loaded while allowing user overrides.<Source url="https://github.com/abcjs-music/obsidian-plugin-abcjs" paths={[{"path":"plugin.ts","range":"25-45"}]} />

---

## Verifying Your Installation

Once installed, you can verify ABCJSPlugin is working by creating or opening a note in Obsidian and adding ABC notation music blocks as per the plugin’s usage instructions. When rendered, the blocks will show music notation generated by the abcjs library.

Run this simple check:

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Test Note">
Open a new note in Obsidian.
</Step>
<Step title="Add ABC Notation">
Insert this snippet:

```abc
X:1
T:Simple Tune
M:4/4
L:1/4
K:C
C D E F | G A B c |
```
</Step>
<Step title="Observe Rendering">
Save and preview the note. You should see rendered music notation corresponding to the ABC notation.
</Step>
</Steps>

If the music notation appears as expected, installation is successful.

<Check>
If no rendering appears, verify the plugin is enabled in Obsidian and the note is loaded in preview mode.
</Check>

<Tip>
If you experience issues where the plugin doesn't load, ensure your Obsidian version is current and community plugins are enabled.
</Tip>
